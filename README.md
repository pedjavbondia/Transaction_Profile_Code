# Transaction_Profile_Code

The Transactional_Profile is a script written in Python, takes a file written as a CSV file, and applies different calculations such as Transaction Average, Transaction per Country, Transaction per Month and Transaction per Description.  

All the procedures and calculations run automatically without any request of methods by the user.  This is how the final client requested it.

# Data Analysis applied with Pandas
All the calculations were applied using Pandas methods.

All the outputs of the different calculations are placed as CSV files in an Output folder that is created by the same Transaction_Profile code.  The name of the folder created is a combination of the date when the script was run and the name of the raw data csv that was given to it

# Quick Settings

Before running the code:

1. Check that you have installed the Pandas package in your computer.
2. Change the CSV_ADDRESS and the OUTPUT_ADDRESS to the ones you are going to use in your local computer.
