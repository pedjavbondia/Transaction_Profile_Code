# Transaction_Profile_Code

# The Transactional_Profile script takes a file written as a CSV file, and applies different calculations such as Transaction Average, Transaction per Country, Transaction per Month and Transaction per Description.  

# All the outputs of the different calculations are placed as CSV files in an Output folder that is created by the same Transaction_Profile code.  The name of the folder created is a combination of the date when the script was run and the name of the raw data csv that was given to it.
